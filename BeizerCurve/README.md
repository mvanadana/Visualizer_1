# Bezier Curve Implementation with Qt and OpenGL
## Overview
This project implements a Bezier curve using Qt and OpenGL. The functionality is encapsulated within a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) and integrated into a Visualizer class to enable visualization.

## Key Features
Utilizes Bezier curve algorithms for smooth curve generation.
Integrates seamlessly with Qt for UI components.
Renders the curve using OpenGL for efficient and dynamic visualization.
