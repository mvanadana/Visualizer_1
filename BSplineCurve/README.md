# B-Spline Implementation
This project contains an implementation of B-splines, a mathematical curve representation commonly used in computer graphics, CAD, and other fields. B-splines are versatile and offer smooth curves defined by control points and knot vectors.

## Features
B-spline Generation: Generate B-spline curves of varying degrees.
Control Point Manipulation: Add, remove, or manipulate control points to modify the resulting curve.
Knot Vector Generation: Automatic generation of knot vectors or manual input.
Curve Evaluation: Evaluate the B-spline curve at specified parameter values.
