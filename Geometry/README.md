# Geometry DLL
The Geometry DLL is a library providing essential geometric classes such as Point, Shape, and Line. These classes serve as foundational elements for various geometric computations and shape manipulations.

## Overview
The project aims to encapsulate fundamental geometric functionalities into a reusable and efficient library. The classes provided within this DLL facilitate geometric calculations, representation, and manipulation.

## Features
### Point Class
Represents a point in a 2D or 3D space.
Includes methods for setting coordinates, return coordinates.
### Shape Class
Base class for geometric shapes.
Provides common functions of setShape with the help of Point vector , Line vector and polylines.

### Line Class
Represents a line segment in 2D.
use Points to create a line.
## Usage
To use the Geometry DLL in your project:
Include the header files (Point.h, Shape.h, Line.h) in your project.
Link your project with the Geometry.dll.
Ensure the DLL is available in the appropriate directory or include its path in your project settings.
