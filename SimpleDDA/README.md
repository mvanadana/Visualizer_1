# SimpleDDA Line Drawing Algorithm
The SimpleDDA algorithm is a fundamental method used in computer graphics to draw a straight line between two points on a raster display. It approximates the line using simple calculations based on the digital difference between endpoints.

## Overview
This project implements the SimpleDDA line drawing algorithm. The algorithm calculates the coordinates of pixels between two given points to render a straight line on a digital screen.

## Features
SimpleDDA Class
Provides methods to draw a straight line between two points on a digital display.
Uses basic arithmetic operations to approximate the line.
## Usage
Include the SimpleDDA.h header file in your project.
Ensure the SimpleDDA library or source files are available.
Create an instance of the SimpleDDA class.
Use the drawLineBySimpleDDA method, providing the coordinates of the two endpoints.
